            <h4>Who I Am</h4>
                <p>The field of programming appealed to me as a young girl; back then, the extent of my programming experience was using HTML on my Neopets' pages to give them a personalized feel. 
                    
                <p>I discovered HTML when I came across a website providing visitors simple HTML code that changed the display of their webpage. At the age of 9, I didn't know about the copy and paste feature on a computer, so I wrote down every line of code to type back into my blank space until I discovered this much more efficient function!</p>

                <p>The years have honed my professional skills, and I'm leagues away from the pen-and-paper transcribing of background colors and hyperlinks. Now, I aspire to bring my sharpened skills to the workplace, bringing value to any company with my professional and personal excellence.</p>

            <h4>Passion for Development</h4>
                <p></p>My passion for programming as a career stemmed from my time in the classroom as a public school teacher. As a way of offering our low-income community options other than a traditional 4-year college degree, the district adopted a basic coding curriculum to inspire students to pursue computer science or software development as a career. Inadvertently through these lessons, the idea became more appealing to me for my own future, and I quit my job as a teacher to pursue it full time.
            <h4>Interests Outside of Development</h4>
