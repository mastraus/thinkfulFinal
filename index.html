            <h4>Who I Am</h4>
            <article>
                <p>The field of programming appealed to me as a young girl; back then, the extent of my programming experience was using HTML on my Neopets' pages to give them a personalized feel. 
                    
                <p>I discovered HTML when I came across a website providing visitors simple HTML code that changed the display of their webpage. At the age of 9, I didn't know about the copy and paste feature on a computer, so I wrote down every line of code to type back into my blank space until I discovered this much more efficient function!</p>

                <p>The years have honed my professional skills, and I'm leagues away from the pen-and-paper transcribing of background colors and hyperlinks. Now, I aspire to bring my sharpened skills to the workplace, bringing value to any company with my professional and personal excellence.</p>

                <p>I am currently residing in beautiful Phoenix, Arizona with my family!

            <h4>Passion for Development</h4>
            <article>
                <p>My passion for programming as a career stemmed from my time in the classroom as a public school teacher. As a way of offering our low-income community options other than a traditional 4-year college degree, the district adopted a basic coding curriculum to inspire students to pursue computer science or software development as a career. Inadvertently through these lessons, the idea became more appealing to me for my own future, and I quit my job as a teacher to pursue it full time. This unique journey into coding has lead me to appreciate the creativity, flexibility, and endless possibilities that the career brings. In the future, I look forward to building an app that will help educators track classroom management concerns!</p>
                <p>Community is a requirement for any field; building a circle of mentors, cheerleaders, and empathetic friends is imperitive for success in a field.</p>
                    <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Mentors:</strong> Sage advice from experts ensures that I can grow and become the best developer possible.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cheerleaders:</strong> Various people who know my character can attest to my perseverence and encourage me to continue when situations get challenging.</li>
                            <li><strong>Empathetic Friends:</strong> Traveling the new road with other beginners can lead to an empathetic understanding of my struggle, my successes, and my fears.</li>
                        </ol>
                    <p>With strong community and personal character traits, I am excited to thrive in this new career and work with others to bring about their successes as well!</p>
